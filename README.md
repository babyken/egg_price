#Project Scope
Eggs are essential daily necessities that are widely used in various food preparations. The price of eggs significantly impacts our overall food expenses. This project aims to investigate any price variations in eggs and their potential impact on our budget.

#Analysis
In the market, eggs are available in various packaging options, such as packs of 4 or dozens. To analyze and test the hypothesis regarding potential differences in unit prices of eggs among different merchants, we will focus on the unit price of each package.

#Further work
- Add more merchants to compare.
